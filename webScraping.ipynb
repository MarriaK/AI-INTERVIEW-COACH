      "\n",
      "Machine Learning Interview Questions For Freshers\n",
      "1. What are some real-life applications of clustering algorithms?\n",
      "Clustering algorithms\n",
      " are used in various real-life applications such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Customer segmentation for targeted marketing\n",
      "Recommendation systems for personalized suggestions\n",
      "Anomaly detection in fraud prevention\n",
      "Image compression to reduce storage \n",
      "Healthcare for grouping patients with similar conditions\n",
      "Document categorization in search engines\n",
      "2. How to choose an optimal number of clusters?\n",
      "Elbow Method\n",
      ": Plot the explained variance or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The “elbow” point, where the curve starts to flatten, indicates the optimal number of clusters.\n",
      "Silhouette Score\n",
      ": Measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters. The optimal number of clusters is the one with the highest average silhouette score.\n",
      "Gap Statistic\n",
      ": Compares the clustering result with a random clustering of the same data. A larger gap between the real and random clustering suggests a more appropriate number of clusters.\n",
      "3. What is feature engineering? How does it affect the model’s performance? \n",
      "Feature engineering\n",
      " refers to developing some new features by using existing features. Sometimes there is a very subtle mathematical relation between some features which if explored properly then the new features can be developed using those mathematical operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there are times when multiple pieces of information are clubbed and provided as a single data column. At those times developing new features and using them help us to gain deeper insights into the data as well as if the features derived are significant enough helps to improve the model’s performance a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. What is overfitting in machine learning and how can it be avoided?\n",
      "Overfitting\n",
      " happens when the model learns patterns as well as the noises present in the data this leads to high performance on the training data but very low performance for data that the model has not seen earlier. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid overfitting there are multiple methods that we can use:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Early stopping of the model’s training in case of validation training stops increasing but the training keeps going on.\n",
      "Using regularization methods like L1 or L2 regularization which is used to penalize the model’s weights to avoid overfitting.\n",
      "5. Why we cannot use linear regression for a classification task?\n",
      "The main reason why we cannot use \n",
      "linear regression\n",
      " for a classification task is that the output of linear regression is continuous and unbounded, while classification requires discrete and bounded output values. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If we use linear regression for the classification task the error function graph will not be convex. A convex graph has only one minimum which is also known as the global minima but in the case of the non-convex graph, there are chances of our model getting stuck at some local minima which may not be the global minima. To avoid this situation of getting stuck at the local minima we do not use the linear regression algorithm for a classification task.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Why do we perform normalization?\n",
      "To achieve stable and fast training of the model we use \n",
      "normalization\n",
      " techniques to bring all the features to a certain scale or range of values. If we do not perform normalization then there are chances that the gradient will not converge to the global or local minima and end up oscillating back and forth. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. What is the difference between precision and recall?\n",
      "Precision is the ratio between the true positives(TP) and all the positive examples (TP+FP) predicted by the model. In other words, precision measures how many of the predicted positive examples are actually true positives. It is a measure of the model’s ability to avoid false positives and make accurate positive predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[Tex]\\text{Precision}=\\frac{TP}{TP\\; +\\; FP}[/Tex]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In recall, we calculate the ratio of true positives (TP) and the total number of examples (TP+FN) that actually fall in the positive class. Recall measures how many of the actual positive examples are correctly identified by the model. It is a measure of the model’s ability to avoid false negatives and identify all positive examples correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[Tex]\\text{Recall}=\\frac{TP}{TP\\; +\\; FN}[/Tex]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. What is the difference between upsampling and downsampling?\n",
      "In upsampling method, we increase the number of samples in the minority class by randomly selecting some points from the minority class and adding them to the dataset repeat this process till the dataset gets balanced for each class. But, here is a disadvantage the training accuracy becomes high as in each epoch model trained more than once in each epoch but the same high accuracy is not observed in the validation accuracy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In downsampling, we decrease the number of samples in the majority class by selecting some random number of points that are equal to the number of data points in the minority class so that the distribution becomes balanced. In this case, we have to suffer from data loss which may lead to the loss of some critical information as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. What is data leakage and how can we identify it?\n",
      "If there is a high correlation between the target variable and the input features then this situation is referred to as data leakage. This is because when we train our model with that highly correlated feature then the model gets most of the target variable’s information in the training process only and it has to do very little to achieve high accuracy. In this situation, the model gives pretty decent performance both on the training as well as the validation data but as we use that model to make actual predictions then the model’s performance is not up to the mark. This is how we can identify data leakage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Explain the classification report and the metrics it includes.\n",
      "The \n",
      "classification report\n",
      " provides key metrics to evaluate a model’s performance, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Precision\n",
      ": The proportion of true positives to all predicted positives, measuring accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
      "Recall\n",
      ": The proportion of true positives to all actual positives, indicating how well the model finds positive instances.\n",
      "F1-Score\n",
      ": The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics.\n",
      "Support\n",
      ": The number of true instances for each class in the dataset.\n",
      "Accuracy\n",
      ": The overall proportion of correct predictions.\n",
      "Macro Average\n",
      ": The average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes, treating them equally.\n",
      "Weighted Average\n",
      ": The average of metrics, weighted by class support, giving more importance to frequent classes.\n",
      "11. What are some of the hyperparameters of the random forest regressor which help to avoid overfitting?\n",
      "The most important hyperparameters of a Random Forest are:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "max_depth:\n",
      " Sometimes the larger depth of the tree can create overfitting. To overcome it, the depth should be limited.\n",
      "n-estimator: \n",
      "It is the number of decision trees we want in our forest.\n",
      "min_sample_split:\n",
      " It is the minimum number of samples an internal node must hold in order to split into further nodes.\n",
      "max_leaf_nodes:\n",
      " It helps the model to control the splitting of the nodes and in turn, the depth of the model is also restricted.\n",
      "12. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?\n",
      "First, let’s understand what is bias and variance:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bias \n",
      "refers to the difference between the actual values and the predicted values by the model. Low bias means the model has learned the pattern in the data and high bias means the model is unable to learn the patterns present in the data i.e the underfitting.\n",
      "Variance \n",
      "refers to the change in accuracy of the model’s prediction on which the model has not been trained. Low variance is a good case but high variance means that the performance of the training data and the validation data vary a lot.\n",
      "If the bias is too low but the variance is too high then that case is known as overfitting. So, finding a balance between these two situations is known as the \n",
      "bias-variance trade-off\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Is it always necessary to use an 80:20 ratio for the train test split?\n",
      "No, there is no such necessary condition that the data must be split into 80:20 ratio. The main purpose of the splitting is to have some data which the model has not seen previously so, that we can evaluate the performance of the model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If the dataset contains let’s say 50,000 rows of data then only 1000 or maybe 2000 rows of data is enough to evaluate the model’s performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14. What is Principal Component Analysis?\n",
      "PCA(Principal Component Analysis)\n",
      " is an unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction technique in which we trade off some information or patterns of the data at the cost of reducing its size significantly. In this algorithm, we try to preserve the variance of the original dataset up to a great extent let’s say 95%. For very high dimensional data sometimes even at the loss of 1% of the variance, we can reduce the data size significantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By using this algorithm we can perform image compression, visualize high-dimensional data as well as make data visualization easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15. What is one-shot learning?\n",
      "One-shot learning\n",
      " is a concept in machine learning where the model is trained to recognize the patterns in datasets from a single example instead of training on large datasets. This is useful when we haven’t large datasets. It is applied to find the similarity and dissimilarities between the two images.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16. What is the difference between Manhattan Distance and Euclidean distance?\n",
      "Both \n",
      "Manhattan Distance\n",
      " and \n",
      "Euclidean distance\n",
      " are two distance measurement techniques. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Manhattan Distance (MD) is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the coordinates of two points along each dimension. \n",
      "[Tex]MD = \\left| x_1 – x_2\\right| +  \\left| y_1-y_2\\right|[/Tex]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Euclidean Distance (ED) is calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between the coordinates of two points along each dimension.\n",
      "[Tex]ED = \\sqrt{\\left ( x_1 – x_2 \\right )^2 + \\left ( y_1-y_2 \\right )^2}[/Tex]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, these two metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the clusters formed by a clustering algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17. What is the difference between one hot encoding and ordinal encoding?\n",
      "One Hot encoding\n",
      " and ordinal encoding both are different methods to convert categorical features to numeric ones the difference is in the way they are implemented. In one hot encoding, we create a separate column for each category and add 0 or 1 as per the value corresponding to that row. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In \n",
      "ordinal encoding\n",
      ", we replace the categories with numbers from 0 to n-1 based on the order or rank where n is the number of unique categories present in the dataset. The main difference between one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding is that one-hot encoding results in a binary matrix representation of the data in the form of 0 and 1, it is used when there is no order or ranking between the dataset whereas ordinal encoding represents categories as ordinal values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18. How can you conclude about the model’s performance using the confusion matrix?\n",
      "Confusion matrix \n",
      "summarizes the performance of a classification model. In a confusion matrix, we get four types of output (in case of a binary classification problem) which are TP, TN, FP, and FN. As we know that there are two diagonals possible in a square, and one of these two diagonals represents the numbers for which our model’s prediction and the true labels are the same. Our target is also to maximize the values along these diagonals. From the confusion matrix, we can calculate various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers\n",
      "19. Explain the working principle of SVM.\n",
      "A data set that is not separable in different classes in one plane may be separable in another plane. This is exactly the idea behind the \n",
      "SVM\n",
      "in this a low dimensional data is mapped to high dimensional data so, that it becomes separable in the different classes. A hyperplane is determined after mapping the data into a higher dimension which can separate the data into categories. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SVM model can even learn non-linear boundaries with the objective that there should be as much margin as possible between the categories in which the data has been categorized. To perform this mapping different types of kernels are used like radial basis kernel, gaussian kernel, polynomial kernel, and many others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20. What is the difference between the k-means and k-means++ algorithms?\n",
      "The only difference between the two is in the way centroids are initialized. In the \n",
      "k-means algorithm\n",
      ", the centroids are initialized randomly from the given points. There is a drawback in this method that sometimes this random initialization leads to non-optimized clusters due to maybe initialization of two clusters close to each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome this problem k-means++ algorithm was formed. In k-means++, the first centroid is selected randomly from the data points. The selection of subsequent centroids is based on their separation from the initial centroids. The probability of a point being selected as the next centroid is proportional to the squared distance between the point and the closest centroid that has already been selected. This guarantees that the centroids are evenly spread apart and lowers the possibility of convergence to less-than-ideal clusters. This helps the algorithm reach the global minima instead of getting stuck at some local minima. \n",

      "Some of the most commonly used similarity measures are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosine Similarity:\n",
      " By considering the two vectors in n – dimension we evaluate the cosine of the angle between the two. The range of this similarity measure varies from [-1, 1] where the value 1 represents that the two vectors are highly similar and -1 represents that the two vectors are completely different from each other.\n",
      "Euclidean or Manhattan Distance: \n",
      "These two values represent the distances between the two points in an n-dimensional plane. The only difference between the two is in the way the two are calculated.\n",
      "Jaccard Similarity:\n",
      " It is also known as IoU or Intersection over union it is widely used in the field of object detection to evaluate the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.\n",
      "22. Whether decision tree or random forest is more robust to the outliers.\n",
      "Decision trees and random forests are both relatively robust to outliers. A random forest model is an ensemble of multiple decision trees so, the output of a random forest model is an aggregate of multiple decision trees. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when we average the results the chances of overfitting get reduced. Hence we can say that the random forest models are more robust to outliers.\n",

      "23. What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? What is their significance?\n",
      "L1 regularization (Lasso regularization)\n",

      "One of the most common and effective methods is by using the t-SNE algorithm which is a short form for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This algorithm uses some non-linear complex methods to reduce the dimensionality of the given data. We can also use PCA or LDA to convert n-dimensional data to 2 – dimensional so, that we can plot it to get visuals for better analysis. But the difference between the PCA and t-SNE is that the former tries to preserve the variance of the dataset but the t-SNE tries to preserve the local similarities in the dataset.\n",

For the model, it becomes difficult to identify the pattern for every feature from the limited number of datasets or we can say that the weights are not optimized properly due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited number of examples used to train the model. Due to this after a certain threshold for the dimensionality of the input data, we have to face the curse of dimensionality.\n",

This causes outliers to disproportionately affect the overall error, leading to misleading results and potentially distorting the model’s performance.\n",
      "MAE\n",
      ", on the other hand, takes the absolute value of the errors. Since it does not square the error terms, the influence of large errors (outliers) is linear rather than exponential, making MAE less sensitive to outliers.\n",
      "36. Why removing highly correlated features are considered a good practice?\n",
      "When two features are highly correlated, they may provide similar information to the model, which may cause overfitting. If there are highly correlated features in the dataset then they unnecessarily increase the dimensionality of the feature space and sometimes create the problem of the curse of dimensionality. If the dimensionality of the feature space is high then the model training may take more time than expected, it will increase the complexity of the model and chances of error. This somehow also helps us to achieve data compression as the features have been removed without much loss of data.\n",

R-squared is particularly important as it reflects the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables, providing a measure of how well our model fits the data. However, Adjusted R-squared also plays a crucial role, especially when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.
